## About the display

It's pretty inexpensive e-Paper display module you could communicate with via SPI
(for example connected to GPIO on Raspberry PI). After drawing something on it, you
could unplug power source and it would persist this drawing. Because of this, it
has low power consumption (during drawing). It also gives ability to update just
a part of the screen which is much faster and leaves rest intact.

You can read more about it [here](http://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.9inch_e-Paper_Module).

## Getting Started

At the beginning, you should go through ["How to use"](http://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.9inch_e-Paper_Module#How_to_use) section provided
